**User requests:**
Create an application that can auto snipe solana tokens based off tweets from accounts. The app will allow me to input accounts to follow in real time and if they post a tweet it auto snipes it. It allows me to input buy settings like mev protect and gas priority and import a private key for a wallet. The application should create a read me that tells me how to set it up as if I was a child. Im assuming it will need twitter api , so guide on how to set that up in the read me. 

Check OUTPUT.md for the complete unaltered output.

## Project Plan

### Project Plan

#### Project: Solana Token Sniper Application

#### Objective:
Develop an application that monitors specified Twitter accounts for tweets containing Solana token information and automatically executes buy orders based on predefined settings.

---

### Main Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize a new project repository.
   - Set up version control (Git).
   - Define project structure.

2. **Twitter API Integration**
   - Register the application on Twitter Developer Portal.
   - Implement API authentication.
   - Develop real-time tweet monitoring using Twitter API.

3. **Wallet Integration**
   - Implement secure private key import functionality.
   - Integrate with Solana wallet for transaction execution.

4. **Auto Snipe Mechanism**
   - Define and implement buy order settings (MEV protection, gas priority).
   - Develop logic to execute buy orders when a relevant tweet is detected.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling for Twitter API, wallet operations, and buy order execution.
   - Add logging for debugging and tracking purposes.

6. **Security Measures**
   - Ensure secure handling of private keys.
   - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information.

7. **Documentation**
   - Create a simple, step-by-step README file.
   - Include instructions for setting up the Twitter API and wallet integration.
   - Provide troubleshooting tips.

8. **Testing**
   - Conduct unit tests for individual components.
   - Perform integration testing.
   - Conduct real-world scenario testing.

9. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the application for deployment.
   - Provide clear instructions for running the application.

### Technical Considerations

- **Twitter API**: Use `tweepy` or a similar library for real-time tweet monitoring.
- **Solana Integration**: Use `solana-py` or a similar library for wallet and transaction operations.
- **RPC Provider**: Choose a reliable Solana RPC provider for low-latency transactions.
- **Security**: Use environment variables for sensitive data and ensure secure key management.
- **Logging**: Implement logging using `logging` module for debugging and tracking.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting to avoid hitting Twitter API usage limits.
- **GUI**: Consider adding a simple GUI using `tkinter` or a similar library for ease of use.
